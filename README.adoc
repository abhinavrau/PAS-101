= https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-application-service[Pivotal Application Service (PAS) ] 101

== Purpose

Deploy a simple Java Spring Boot application to Pivotal PAS.

== Setup

. Download and install http://jdk.java.net/8/[Java 8] or above for your Operating system and make sure JAVA_HOME is set to your JDK directory.

. Download and install https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git] for your operating system and install it.

. Contact your company's PAS Admin to create an account for you on PAS and login to the PCF Apps Manager.
Alternatively go to https://pws.pivotal.io/ and create a free account on Pivotal Web Services (PWS) which is public.

. Login to PCF Apps Manager and click on *Tools* on the left navigation bar and download and install
the Cloud Foundry CLI for your operating system.


. Open your terminal and login in using CF CLI with the api endpoint shown on the *Tools* page ( for PWS it is https://api.run.pivotal.io ):


    $ cf login -a <your api enpoint>


Follow the prompts to enter your username and password. If you have multiple Orgs or spaces, you will be asked to select
 an Org and space where applications should be deployed when you do a "cf push".

== Build It

Linux/macOS

    $ ./mvnw package


Windows
----
> mvnw.bat package
----

== Push It!

Push the application!

----
$ cf push
----

You should see output similar to the following listing. Take a look at the listing callouts for a play-by-play of what's happening:
